# Number Guessing Game (Python)

A beginner-friendly Python mini project.

## 🚀 Features

* 🎮 **Multiple Difficulty Levels**
  Choose between Easy (1–10, 5 attempts), Medium (1–50, 7 attempts), and Hard (1–100, 10 attempts), making the game suitable for all skill levels.

* 🧠 **Smart Hints System**
  The game provides feedback after each guess:

  * 📉 Too Low — the guessed number is smaller than the target
  * 📈 Too High — the guessed number is greater than the target

* 🏆 **Score System**
  Score is calculated based on remaining attempts. Fewer guesses result in a higher score.

* 🥇 **Best Score Tracking**
  Tracks and displays the highest score achieved during the session.

* 🔁 **Replay Option**
  Allows the player to restart the game without exiting the program.

* ⚠ **Input Validation**
  Handles invalid inputs (like text instead of numbers) without crashing the game.

* 🎯 **Core Gameplay Logic**
  A random number is generated, and the player must guess it within a limited number of attempts to win.
